# Executive Summary - Sports Data Analytics Project

## Overview
The Sports Data Analytics Project aims to harness the power of data to revolutionize predictive modeling in the world of sports. Through comprehensive data gathering, advanced statistical analysis, and the incorporation of external factors, we strive to become one of the most accurate predictive modelers in the industry.

## Goals
1. **Data Gathering**: Build a robust and regularly updated database encompassing horse racing, NFL, NCAA football, NCAA basketball, and PGA Tour/Major Golf data. Leverage APIs, web scraping, and other methods to acquire the most relevant and comprehensive data.
