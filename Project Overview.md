# Project Overview - Sports Data Analytics Project

## Introduction
The Sports Data Analytics Project aims to leverage the power of data to revolutionize predictive modeling in the world of sports. By harnessing comprehensive sports data, applying advanced statistical analysis, and integrating external factors, we strive to become leaders in accurate and insightful sports predictions.

## Current Scope
The initial phase of the project will focus on the following key areas:

1. **Data Gathering**
   - Research and identify reliable data sources for horse racing, NFL, NCAA football, NCAA basketball, and PGA Tour/Major Golf.
   - Utilize APIs, web scraping, and other methods to collect and store relevant data.
   - Establish a daily updated database with historical data for the last 7 years (excluding the outlier COVID-19 years of 2020-2021).

2. **Advanced Stats and Analytics**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and patterns within the collected data.
   - Develop advanced statistical models and analytical techniques to generate insights and identify key performance indicators.
   - Utilize Python, SQLite, and visualization libraries to conduct in-depth data analysis.

3. **Incorporation of External Factors**
   - Identify external factors such as weather conditions, elevation, and other relevant variables that may impact sports outcomes.
   - Gather additional data related to these factors and integrate them into the predictive models.
   - Evaluate the impact of external factors on model accuracy and refine the predictive algorithms accordingly.

4. **Predictive Modeling and Accuracy**
   - Develop predictive models that utilize the collected data, advanced statistical techniques, and external factors to forecast sports outcomes.
   - Continuously evaluate and optimize the models to improve accuracy and performance.
   - Validate the models against real-world data and fine-tune them for increased precision.
