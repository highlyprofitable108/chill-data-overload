## Project Success Metric: Predictive Model Performance Metric

The success of the Sports Data Analytics Project will be determined by the overall performance of the predictive models developed. An essential metric for evaluating the success of the project is the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**, which measures the average percentage difference between the predicted outcomes and the actual outcomes. The lower the MAPE value, the higher the accuracy of the predictive models.

The target MAPE for the project will be defined based on the specific sport and its inherent complexities. The ultimate goal is to achieve a MAPE that demonstrates a significant improvement over existing predictive models and establishes the project as a reliable and accurate predictor of sports outcomes.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

### Risk: Data Source Reliability
- Description: The selected data sources may experience downtime, inconsistent data quality, or even become unavailable.
- Impact: Incomplete or unreliable data may affect the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.
- Likelihood: Moderate
- Severity: Moderate
- Mitigation:
  - Identify multiple reliable data sources to mitigate dependency on a single source.
  - Implement error handling mechanisms to handle data source unavailability or data inconsistencies.
  - Regularly monitor the data sources for any changes or disruptions.
  - Have a backup plan in place to switch to alternative data sources if needed.

### Risk: Model Performance and Generalization
- Description: The developed predictive models may perform well on the training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.
- Impact: Poor model performance on new data may reduce the reliability and practicality of the predictive models.
- Likelihood: Moderate
- Severity: High
- Mitigation:
  - Utilize cross-validation techniques and validation datasets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
  - Regularly monitor and fine-tune the models to ensure optimal performance and generalization.
  - Incorporate regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization.

### Risk: Insufficient External Data
- Description: The availability or quality of external factors' data, such as weather conditions, may be limited or inconsistent.
- Impact: Inadequate or inaccurate external data may weaken the models' ability to incorporate crucial factors, reducing prediction accuracy.
- Likelihood: High
- Severity: Moderate
- Mitigation:
  - Thoroughly research and identify reliable sources of external data.
  - Implement data validation and verification procedures to ensure the quality and consistency of external data.
  - Consider alternative sources or techniques if the desired external data is unavailable or unreliable.
  - Perform sensitivity analysis to assess the models' robustness to variations in external data.

### Risk: Computational Resource Limitations
- Description: The computational resources required for data analysis, model training, and optimization may be insufficient.
- Impact: Limited computational resources may result in longer processing times, slower iterations, and restricted model complexity.
- Likelihood: Moderate
- Severity: Low
- Mitigation:
  - Optimize code efficiency and utilize parallel computing techniques to make the most of available resources.
  - Prioritize and allocate computational resources effectively for critical tasks.
  - Consider utilizing cloud-based computing resources or distributed computing frameworks if needed.

### Risk: Lack of Domain Expertise
- Description: Insufficient understanding of the sports domain and relevant factors may limit the accuracy and relevance of the predictive models.
- Impact: Inadequate domain expertise may lead to incorrect assumptions, ineffective feature engineering, or misinterpretation of results.
- Likelihood: Low
- Severity: Moderate
- Mitigation:
  - Collaborate with domain experts or consultants to gain insights into the specific sports domain and associated factors.
  - Continuously educate the team on the intricacies of the sports being analyzed.
  - Conduct thorough research to
