## Project Tasks

### Common Tasks:
1. Data Gathering:
   - Fetch historical data for each sport from reputable sources (e.g., API calls, web scraping).
   - **Sample method:** Utilize the Equibase API for horse racing data.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
   - Clean and standardize the retrieved data to ensure consistency and reliability.
   - Perform necessary transformations (e.g., converting data types, handling missing values).
   - **Sample method:** Use Python and pandas library for data cleaning and transformation.

3. Database Setup:
   - Set up a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store the sports data.
   - Design an appropriate schema to accommodate the specific data points.
   - **Sample method:** Use MySQL for the database setup.

4. API Integration:
   - Implement API integration to automate the data retrieval process and update the database regularly.
   - Set up scheduled API calls to fetch new data at specified intervals.
   - **Sample method:** Utilize Python and libraries like requests and cron for API integration.

5. Data Analysis and Visualization:
   - Analyze the collected data to generate common statistical metrics and visualizations.
   - Explore data patterns, trends, and insights to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sports.
   - **Sample method:** Utilize Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

### Sport-Specific Tasks:

#### Horse Racing:
1. Calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Develop KPIs for horses, jockeys, and trainers based on race results and performance.
   - Analyze factors like win percentage, average speed, and earnings.
   - **Sample method:** Implement Python functions to calculate KPIs based on specific formulas.

2. Track Conditions Analysis:
   - Investigate the impact of different track conditions on race outcomes.
   - Incorporate weather data to analyze correlations between track conditions and race results.
   - **Sample method:** Use Python libraries to merge and analyze track and weather data.

#### NFL:
1. Player and Team Performance Metrics:
   - Calculate various performance metrics for players and teams, such as passing yards, touchdowns, and team rankings.
   - Analyze trends and correlations between different metrics.
   - **Sample method:** Utilize Python functions to calculate performance metrics based on relevant statistics.

2. Matchup Analysis:
   - Analyze historical matchups between teams to identify patterns and predict outcomes.
   - Consider factors like head-to-head records, home-field advantage, and previous performance.
   - **Sample method:** Develop Python functions to aggregate and analyze matchup data.
