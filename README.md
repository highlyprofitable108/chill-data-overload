# Sports Data Analytics Project

Welcome to the Sports Data Analytics Project! This project aims to leverage comprehensive sports data to develop advanced predictive models and provide valuable insights in the domain of sports analytics.

## Project Overview
The Sports Data Analytics Project focuses on gathering data, performing in-depth analysis, and developing predictive models for various sports including horse racing, NFL, NCAA football, NCAA basketball, and PGA Tour/Major Golf. By utilizing data-driven methodologies and incorporating external factors, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our predictions.

## Features
- **Data Gathering**: Collecting comprehensive historical data from various reliable sources.
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Conducting exploratory data analysis and applying advanced statistical techniques to extract insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing and fine-tuning predictive models to forecast sports outcomes.
- **Incorporation of External Factors**: Considering external factors like weather conditions, elevation, and other variables that may impact sports outcomes.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly refining models and updating the database to improve accuracy over time.
