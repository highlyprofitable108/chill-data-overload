# Requirements Document - Sports Data Analytics Project

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the Sports Data Analytics Project. The project aims to leverage comprehensive sports data to develop accurate predictive models and provide valuable insights in the domain of sports analytics.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Data Gathering**
   - The system shall research and identify reliable data sources for horse racing, NFL, NCAA football, NCAA basketball, and PGA Tour/Major Golf.
   - The system shall utilize APIs, web scraping, and other methods to collect and store relevant data.
   - The system shall maintain a daily updated database with historical data for the last 7 years (excluding the outlier COVID-19 years of 2020-2021).

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - The system shall handle large volumes of data efficiently and provide timely responses.
   - The system shall execute complex statistical computations within acceptable time limits.

2. **Usability**
   - The system shall provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration, model configuration, and result interpretation.
   - The system shall support visualizations and interactive displays to facilitate data analysis.

3. **Reliability**
   - The system shall maintain data integrity and ensure consistent results across multiple executions.
   - The system shall handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages for troubleshooting.

4. **Security**
   - The system shall implement appropriate measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of collected data.

## Conclusion
This requirements document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Sports Data Analytics Project. By adhering to these requirements, we aim to develop a robust system that leverages comprehensive sports data, incorporates external factors, and delivers accurate predictive models and insightful analysis in the realm of sports analytics.
