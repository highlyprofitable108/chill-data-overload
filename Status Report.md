**Project Status Report - Planning Session**

*Date: 05/16/2023*

1. **Goal Refinement:** We solidified our goal of becoming one of the most accurate predictive modelers in the world. Dream big, right? We want to have all the sports data at our fingertips, create advanced stats, and incorporate external factors like weather and elevation to boost our models' accuracy.

2. **Project Plan:** We devised a witty and sassy project plan to guide us on this epic journey. The plan is broken down into phases, allowing us to tackle data gathering, advanced stats, external factors, and predictive modeling in a structured and manageable way.

3. **Current Progress:** We discussed the first phase of the project, which involves data gathering and setup. We established the order in which we'll obtain data for each sport, considering factors such as data availability and ease of access. The roadmap for the next two weeks was also outlined, aligning with our limited availability of 10-15 hours per week.

**Next Steps - Over the Next Few Days:**

1. **Data Gathering (Week 1):**
   - [Specific task for each sport, e.g., Retrieve PGA Tour/Major Golf historical data and clean it up.]
   - Allocate time to explore the available APIs and data sources for each sport to ensure a smooth data retrieval process.

2. **Setup and Preparation:**
   - Spend time configuring the development environment and installing necessary tools and libraries.
   - Familiarize ourselves with the documentation of the chosen data sources and APIs to ensure efficient usage.

3. **Communication and Collaboration:**
   - Maintain open lines of communication within the team to address any challenges or questions that may arise during the data gathering process.
   - Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing by sharing any useful resources or insights related to the project.

Keep up the enthusiasm, team! The next few days will be dedicated to diving headfirst into data gathering, cleaning, and organizing. Remember to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments along the way.

If you have any questions, concerns, or witty remarks (because who doesn't love those?), feel free to reach out. Let's continue this thrilling journey and conquer the sports data universe together!
